        [Verse 1] <br>
        Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter <br>
        Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here<br><br>

        Little darling, the smile's returning to the faces<br>
        Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        Here comes the sun<br>
        Here comes the sun<br>
        And I say, "It's alright"<br><br>

        [Bridge]<br>
        Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
        Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
        Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
        Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
        Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br><br>
        
        [Verse 3]<br>
        Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting<br>
        Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)<br>

        Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)<br>
        Here comes the sun<br>
        It's alright<br>
        It's alright<br></p>
